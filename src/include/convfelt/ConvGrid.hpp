/**
 * This header contains the grid structures used by ConvFelt.
 *
 * Each convolution has a iw*ih*id sized input volume. Each filter then has a cw*ch*id window on
 * that volume, defined by the offset (dw, dh), for a total number of windows ww*wh. So we have a 5D
 * input grid of size ww*wh*(ww*cw)*(wh*ch)*id.
 *
 * A convolution then has an associated output data grid of size (Cw*ww)*(Ch*wh)*Cd, where each
 * filter produces an output grid of size Cw*Ch*Cd resulting from a (cw*ch*id)x(Cw*Ch*Cd) matrix
 * applied to the input window.
 *
 * Each filter has its input data window copied into its own spatial partition. This gives a spatial
 * partition size of (ww, wh, cw, ch, id), that is, it is partitioned only along the input image
 * width and height in steps of (cw, ch), with a (dw, dh) initial offset.
 *
 * The output spatial partition size is the filter's output size (Cw, Ch, Cd).
